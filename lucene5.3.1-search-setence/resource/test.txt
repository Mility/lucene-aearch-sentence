Some people like doing a job constantly all through their lives.
Because they can work more effectively by do invariable job. they can knew about what they do precisely, and put all their hearts into the job. Furthermore, they can create some new find in theories and factories and achieve success in this job. Some other people are prefer to changing job adequately. Because they think that this can increase their abilities in different aspects. Final, they become advanced persons of all high abilities in every aspect. On my opinion, the two kinds of view states as before are all reasonable. We do works, should understood two spirits also. In my practice, should take account off two aspects too. I think if I do the job, I might take the latter choice, when I has increased all abilities in all aspects, mastered variable skills, then chosen a constant job which I loved very much then devoted it for all my life.
